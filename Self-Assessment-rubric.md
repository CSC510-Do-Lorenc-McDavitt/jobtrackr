|Other automated analysis tools |3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1/tree/main/docs|
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... |3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1/tree/main/docs
|but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1/tree/main/docs|
|Number of commits|3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1/tree/main/docs
|Number of commits: by different people|3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1/tree/main/docs
|Issues reports: there are **many**|3| git
|Issues are being closed|3| pycodestyle, flake8
|DOI badge: exists |3|Prettier code formatter used
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |3|pylint, eslint used to check the code syntax
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1
|ODocs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1/blob/main/__tests__/App.test.jsx

|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|3|Yes. We have a WhatsApp group to discuss the projects.
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1/issues
|Chat channel: exists|3|github, VSCode
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3|.prettierrc, .eslintrc, .babelrc, .pylintrc
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3|Everyone can demostrate the project
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|3|frontend, backend, database, documentation, Github Actions, Tests
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3|evidence
